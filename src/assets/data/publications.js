    abstract: `Using ultrafast ≃2.5fs and ≃25fs self-amplified spontaneous emission pulses of increasing intensity and 
    a novel experimental scheme, we report the concurrent increase of stimulated emission in the forward direction and 
    loss of out-of-beam diffraction contrast for a Co/Pd multilayer sample. The experimental results are quantitatively 
    accounted for by a statistical description of the pulses in conjunction with the optical Bloch equations. The 
    dependence of the stimulated sample response on the incident intensity, coherence time, and energy jitter of the 
    employed pulses reveals the importance of increased control of x-ray free electron laser radiation.`,

    abstract: `Vanadium dioxide (VO2), an archetypal correlated-electron material, undergoes an insulator-metal 
    transition near room temperature that exhibits electron-correlation-driven and structurally driven physics. Using 
    ultrafast temperature- and fluence-dependent optical spectroscopy and x-ray scattering, we show that multiple 
    interrelated electronic and structural processes in the nonequilibrium dynamics in VO2 can be disentangled in the 
    time domain. Specifically, following intense subpicosecond terahertz (THz) electric-field excitation, a partial 
    collapse of the insulating gap occurs within the first picosecond. At temperatures sufficiently close to the 
    transition temperature and for THz peak fields above a threshold of approximately 1 MV/cm, this electronic 
    reconfiguration initiates a change in lattice symmetry taking place on a slower timescale. We identify the kinetic 
    energy increase of electrons tunneling in the strong electric field as the driving force, illustrating a promising 
    method to control electronic and structural interactions in correlated materials on an ultrafast timescale.`,

    abstract: `Magnetostriction, the strain induced by a change in magnetization, is a universal effect in magnetic 
    materials. Owing to the difficulty in unraveling its microscopic origin, it has been largely treated 
    phenomenologically. Here, we show how the source of magnetostriction—the underlying magnetoelastic stress—can be 
    separated in the time domain, opening the door for an atomistic understanding. X-ray and electron diffraction are 
    used to separate the sub-picosecond spin and lattice responses of FePt nanoparticles. Following excitation with a 
    50-fs laser pulse, time-resolved X-ray diffraction demonstrates that magnetic order is lost within the nanoparticles
     with a time constant of 146 fs. Ultrafast electron diffraction reveals that this demagnetization is followed by an 
     anisotropic, three-dimensional lattice motion. Analysis of the size, speed, and symmetry of the lattice motion, 
     together with ab initio calculations accounting for the stresses due to electrons and phonons, allow us to reveal 
     the magnetoelastic stress generated by demagnetization.`,

    abstract: `Light-matter interaction at the nanoscale in magnetic materials is a topic of intense research in view of
     potential applications in next-generation high-density magnetic recording. Laser-assisted switching provides a 
     pathway for overcoming the material constraints of high-anisotropy and high-packing density media, though much 
     about the dynamics of the switching process remains unexplored. We use ultrafast small-angle X-ray scattering at an
      X-ray free-electron laser to probe the magnetic switching dynamics of FePt nanoparticles embedded in a carbon 
      matrix following excitation by an optical femtosecond laser pulse. We observe that the combination of laser 
      excitation and applied static magnetic field, 1 order of magnitude smaller than the coercive field, can overcome 
      the magnetic anisotropy barrier between “up” and “down” magnetization, enabling magnetization switching. This 
      magnetic switching is found to be inhomogeneous throughout the material with some individual FePt nanoparticles 
      neither switching nor demagnetizing. The origin of this behavior is identified as the near-field modification of 
      the incident laser radiation around FePt nanoparticles. The fraction of not-switching nanoparticles is influenced 
      by the heat flow between FePt and a heat-sink layer.`,
