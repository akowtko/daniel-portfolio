    abstract: `Using ultrafast ≃2.5fs and ≃25fs self-amplified spontaneous emission pulses of increasing intensity and 
    a novel experimental scheme, we report the concurrent increase of stimulated emission in the forward direction and 
    loss of out-of-beam diffraction contrast for a Co/Pd multilayer sample. The experimental results are quantitatively 
    accounted for by a statistical description of the pulses in conjunction with the optical Bloch equations. The 
    dependence of the stimulated sample response on the incident intensity, coherence time, and energy jitter of the 
    employed pulses reveals the importance of increased control of x-ray free electron laser radiation.`,
